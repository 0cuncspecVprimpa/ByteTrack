One option is to download a free trial version of SolidWorks from the official website[^2^]. This will allow you to use the software for 30 days with full functionality. However, you will need to register with your email address and provide some personal information. You will also need to download a large installer file (about 15 GB) and install it on your computer.
 
Another option is to download a free student version of SolidWorks from the official website[^2^]. This will allow you to use the software for 12 months with limited functionality. However, you will need to be a student or an educator at a qualified academic institution. You will also need to provide proof of eligibility and request a serial number. You will also need to download a large installer file (about 15 GB) and install it on your computer.
 
A third option is to download a free version of SolidWorks from a third-party website[^1^]. This will allow you to use the software without any time or functionality restrictions. However, this is not a legal or safe option, as you may be downloading a pirated or infected version of SolidWorks. You may also be violating the terms and conditions of SolidWorks and risking legal consequences. You may also encounter compatibility or performance issues with your computer.
 
As you can see, there is no easy or legal way to download SolidWorks for free on Windows 32-bit. The best option is to use the official trial or student versions of SolidWorks, as they are safe and reliable. However, they have some limitations and requirements that you need to consider. Alternatively, you can look for other free or cheaper CAD software that can run on Windows 32-bit, such as SketchUp, FreeCAD or Blender.
  
## What is SolidWorks and Why Use It?
 
SolidWorks is a CAD software that allows you to create 3D models of various objects and systems. You can use it to design products, machines, structures, vehicles, and more. You can also use it to perform simulations, analyses, and tests on your models, such as stress, fluid, thermal, and motion. SolidWorks can help you to improve your design quality, efficiency, and innovation.
 
SolidWorks is one of the most popular and widely used CAD software in the world. It has a user-friendly interface and a large community of users and support. It also has a rich library of features and tools that can meet your design needs and preferences. SolidWorks can integrate with other software and platforms, such as Microsoft Office, MATLAB, 3DEXPERIENCE, and more. SolidWorks can also export and import various file formats, such as STL, STEP, IGES, DWG, DXF, and more.
  
## What are the System Requirements for SolidWorks?
 
SolidWorks is a powerful and complex software that requires a high-performance computer to run smoothly and efficiently. The minimum system requirements for SolidWorks are as follows:
 
- Operating System: Windows 10 64-bit
- Processor: Intel or AMD with SSE2 support
- Memory: 16 GB RAM
- Graphics Card: Certified cards and drivers
- Hard Disk: SSD with 50 GB free space
- Internet Connection: Required for installation, activation, and updates

As you can see, SolidWorks does not support Windows 32-bit operating systems. This means that you cannot run SolidWorks on your Windows 32-bit computer. You will need to upgrade your computer to a Windows 64-bit operating system and meet the other system requirements for SolidWorks. Alternatively, you can use a different computer that has Windows 64-bit operating system and meets the system requirements for SolidWorks.
